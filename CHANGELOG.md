## [Unreleased]

### Changed — dependency bump for in-player quality selection (G2)

- **`@phlix/ui` bumped to `v0.74.0`, `@phlix/contracts` to `v0.2.0`** (from
  `v0.55.0` / `v0.1.1`) in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. This pulls in
  `@phlix/ui`'s `QualityMenu` (the on-screen stream-quality picker rendered in
  the player's control bar, shown whenever there are ≥2 switchable hls.js ABR
  rungs) and `@phlix/contracts`'s `Rendition` / `variants` types.
- **No application code changes were needed.** This app has a real mouse and
  keyboard, not a D-pad — unlike the sibling `phlix-tizen-client`, which needed
  a remote-input bridge (yellow-button open/close, D-pad Arrow suppression,
  `MutationObserver` + `router.afterEach` teardown) so its TV remote could
  drive the picker. Here, `QualityMenu` is `@phlix/ui`'s ARIA-`combobox`
  `Select`; its canonical keyboard path (`ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown` to open and
  navigate, `Enter` to confirm, `Escape`/`Tab` to close) and plain mouse clicks
  both work out of the box through ordinary browser focus handling — nothing
  in this repo intercepts keyboard input for the renderer (the only
  `keydown`-adjacent handling is the Electron application **menu accelerators**
  in `src/main/index.ts`: `Space` play/pause, `Left`/`Right` rewind/forward,
  `F11` fullscreen, `CmdOrCtrl+O`/`CmdOrCtrl+,`). Those accelerators collide
  with zero of the Select's primary Arrow/Enter/Escape path; only the
  redundant `Space`-to-select affordance is shadowed by the play/pause
  accelerator, which is not a regression worth bridging.
- No default-quality wiring was added: `PhlixAppConfig` (the object passed to
  `createPhlixApp`) has no default-quality field — `defaultQuality` is a
  `@phlix/ui` `usePreferencesStore` user preference set via the shared
  Settings screen, not something this Electron shell configures at boot.
